<h1>What is PvP/1v1 Tetris?</h1>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p class="p1">PvP Tetris is a style of modern pro Tetris that revolves around two players playing in real time 
simultaneously. They stack pieces and clear lines to send more lines (the gray lines called "garbage") to the 
other player, and the first person to reach the top of their board loses. The technical rules are a bit complicated, 
but basically the more lines you clear at once, and the faster <br> you clear lines, and the more intricate your line clearing
methods are, the more garbage you <br> send. Getting several consecutive line clears gives you a combo, and this usually
also allows you to send more garbage to your opponent's board, however the bonus garbage sent from the combo depends on 
the actual game platform and how much the garbage system of that game values combos.
<br><br>
In addition to this, modern Tetris game engines allow you to do some weird things with the pieces, like spin them around and move them side to side 
really quickly. This allows you to perform more advanced piece maneuvers to clear lines (like a tuck, T-spin, I-spin, etc., but you don't really need to know what those mean or how to do them). When used properly, these maneuvers can be used to send more garbage to an opponent's board more quickly, but they can be very hard to set up. Back in the old 1984 version of Tetris on the NES, these moves were pretty much impossible, and the game's scoring system didn't reward you at all for being able to pull off these moves, but the scoring system and PvP system in almost all modern Tetris games incentivizes players to go for these moves much more often.

<p class="p2">There are several games that offter this style of Tetris including 
Tetris Friends, Tetris Effect, Jstris, <br> and Tetris Online Poland, but the most popular and accessible one is a
game (and site) called <br> <a href="https://tetr.io/" class="link">Tetr.io.</a> The video below is a round from a tournament game that was played last year by Doremy <br> (#1 Tetr.io player in France) and VinceHD (#1 Tetrio player in the Philippines). Players around the <br> world often develop their own playstyle and stacking habits as they get better. It can be a little hard <br> to see because everything is happening in a flash, but Doremy's playstyle in this match focuses on <br> much more efficient and defensive stacking, while Vince's has a large emphasis on raw speed and <br> offensive stacking for big spikes (a term used to refer to when a large wave of garbage is sent to <br> an opponent).
<br><br>
Tetr.io has about 3 million players as of right now, with over 166 million games of Tetris finished. <br> You can go online, queue for a game in 3 clicks, and get paired up with someone from a random part <br> of the world who is about your skill level, and you play a best of 3/5/7 rounds for one game. <br> The winner climbs in the global leaderboards, and the loser gets knocked further down in the <br> global leaderboards. Right now I'm at the upper half of S+ rank in Tetr.io which is about the top 15% <br> of players in the world.
