<h1>What is Soloplay Tetris?</h1>

<p class="p1">Soloplay Tetris isn't really a set name, but it describes competitive Tetris where games are 
played asynchronously by different players, and <br>
the scores often get uploaded to some kind of online leaderboard. Different games and gamemodes incentivize different strategies 
and stacking <br> methods, however almost all of them have a heavy emphasis on speed (how many pieces you can place down a second)
and efficiency <br> (how much score you can get per line clear). A few of the most popular game modes are highlighted here:

<p class="sprinttext">Sprint is a mode where you're given a set amount of lines to clear <br> (the most popular being 40, sometimes 20 or 100)
 and you have to <br> clear that amount of lines as fast as possible. On the left is a 100 line <br> sprint done by Japanese player Yakine 
on the Tetris game Jstris. In this <br> mode, what matters most is raw speed, as it doesn't matter how you <br> stack your pieces,
as long as those lines disappear as fast as possible. </p>

<p class="blitztext">Blitz or Ultra (depending on whether it's played on Jstris or Tetr.io) <br> is a bit different. You're given a set amount of time,
(often two minutes), <br> and in that time you need to get as much score as possible, that's to say that <br> this mode rewards efficiency
more than anything, but speed is still important. <br> There are different ways of getting lots of score, but
the most efficient way to <br> do it is to get as many 'perfect clears' as possible (a perfect clear is achieved <br> when your board is 
completely empty), so the top Ultra players memorize <br> hundreds of piece combinations to find 'solutions' to achieve these 
'perfect <br> clears'. On the left is a famous ultra player from the U.K. who goes by <br> Smolfeesh, achieving 1.1 million points on Tetr.io Blitz,
with 30 perfect clears</p>

<p class="cheesetext">Cheese Race is a completely different mode of play that requires lots of <br> creativity and foresight, as well as speed.
You start the mode with messy <br> garbage on the bottom half of your board, and the goal is to clear a certain <br> amount of garbage lines
as quickly as possible (usually 18 or 100 on Jstris). <br> Garbage lines keep appearing as you keep clearing them, and sometimes 
<br> counterintuitive piece placements can give you an easier time accessing more <br> garbage lines down the board, so players 
stack while visualizing 4-5 pieces ahead. <br> This is a cheese race play by z2sam, clearing 100 garbage lines 
in 1 minute and <br> 19 seconds. </p>
