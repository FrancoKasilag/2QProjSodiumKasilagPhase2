<h1>Inhuman Reflexes: A Look At Modern Competitive Tetris</h1>
<h2>Tetris (1984)</h2>
<p>I think we're all familiar with the concept and basic rules of Tetris <br>
(drop pieces, form horizontal lines, don't reach the top) so I'll skip over that,<br>
but a lot of younger people now don't actually know that Tetris started with <br>
Nintendo's NES Tetris from 1984. Back when NES Tetris was pretty much <br> 
the only version of Tetris played, there wasn't really a "competitive" scene, <br> 
since at the time Social Media didn't exist, the concept of Esports wasn't a <br> 
thing, and most kids only played with their friends for fun. This is a large <br>
reason why Tetris even now isn't really seen as a spectator sport, but <br>
hidden under the old 1984 facade is a GIANT scene of competition.
<br> <br>
After a while, Tetris got imported from the NES game console to the PC <br>
and got several versions and remakes, making slight gameplay mechanic <br>
changes (more on this in the linked pages). Hardware has evolved <br>
massively as well, with the rise of popularity of mechanical keyboards, <br>
gaming monitors and very powerful computers. To add, the abilities of <br>
players have improved immensely, i.e. reaction time, finger speed, <br>
hand-eye coordination, and evolution of strategies. Because of all this, <br>
pro Tetris players from both the 1984 Classic Tetris game and the <br>
modern PC ports of Tetris got INSANELY GOOD. <br>
