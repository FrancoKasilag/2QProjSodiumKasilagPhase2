<p class="p1"> Some context before this: A "battle royale" game, such as PUBG, Fortnite, and <br> Apex Legends, 
traditionally puts a certain amount of players in a map, often with <br> guns or other weapons, and has them fight to
the death to see which player or <br> team is left standing (yes, like squid game). This means that the players with
the <br> most skill in the context of what the game demands will often survive longer and <br> probably win. </p>

<p class="p2"> Now take that image, and replace the guns with puzzle pieces and the map with a <br> giant lobby of people playing 
Tetris, and you get the most popular Tetris Battle Royale, <br> Tetris 99 (this isn't the only free-for-all Tetris game, but it's easily
the most iconic). <br> For the most part it uses the same garbage as PvP Tetris, but your garbage gets sent to <br> random people and
someone's garbage randomly gets sent to you. If you top out, you lose, <br> so survive as long as possible as the Tetriminos fall
faster and faster.
