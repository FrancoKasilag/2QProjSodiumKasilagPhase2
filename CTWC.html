<h2>Classic Tetris Mechanics</h2>

<p class="p1">Before all the modern Tetris games (Tetr.io, Puyo Puyo Tetris, Tetris Friends, etc.) came about, there was NES Tetris from 1984, 
which is the original version of tetris most adults remember and a version which could only be played authentically on Nintendo's old NES 
console. This version of Tetris, was completely different from the modern games, as everything was made much more difficult and much 
more strict. You had no "hold" option to save a piece you don't want to use, you could
only see one piece ahead, and pieces were given completely randomly (contrary to modern Tetris games that give you pieces on a 7-bag
system, where each of the pieces appears once every 7 pieces). In addition to this, the blocks felt much more "sticky", meaning that once
a piece was put down, it stuck to the board like glue and you couldn't move it anywhere, which made fancy modern Tetris moves like
T-spins extremely difficult, and misdrops fatal if not extremely punishing. In a sense, you could say this was Tetris in its "purest form".
The best players weren't distinguished by strategy, they were distinguished by raw physical ability to spam the NES controller's buttons, 
and their stacking cleanliness to adapt to the complete randomness of the pieces. </p>

<h2 class="header2">What's the CTWC?</h2>

<p class="p2">Even with the rise of more popular modern Tetris engines, the people who loved the classic 1984 <br> NES Tetris stuck around,
and they created a tournament called the Classic Tetris World Championship <br> back in 2010. It was a single elimination bracket, and players
played on CRT monitors with old school <br> NES controllers. The game rewarded a vastly different skillset from modern games, where
flashiness, <br> absurd speed, and stacking creativity meant nothing. While top players of the CTWC look very slow <br> and boring, if you
take time to study the specifics of the mechanics of NES Tetris, you'll find them <br> doing things like vibrating their hands on the
controllers to move the pieces faster or manipulating <br> the input delay of the game engine using sometimes frame-perfect inputs
(1/60th of a second). <br> On the right is the Finals of the 2018 CTWC, where 16 year-old newcomer Joseph Saelee beats the <br> 7-time world
champion Jonas Neubauer. As of right now the pro scene for NES Tetris is full of <br> teenagers who can manipulate the NES
Controller in insane ways too elaborate to describe <br> just through text.</p>
